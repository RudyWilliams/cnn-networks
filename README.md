## cnn-networks

This repo contains the code for implemeting a _convolutional neural network_ (CNN). The arcitecture of build.py is based on the 
[LeNet-5](https://engmrk.com/lenet-5-a-classic-cnn-architecture/). The code is mostly based off of  this [keras 
tutorial](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py).
